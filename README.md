# NokkoWiki
A private wiki for my DnD players. Info they find in the campaign goes on the wiki.

Next up,  
[] switching to a cheaper instance (consider t4g nano; free till 31st March 2021)  
[] switching to HTTPS from HTTP  
[] getting an actual domain and have the public IPs point to that (April 2021, if we are still using this)
